pymls: Python Plane Waves Solver
===============================

pymls allows to solve acoustic propagation problems through structures with multiple layers
using Dazel *et al.*'s method as described in "A stable to model the acoustic response of
multilayered structures" (Journal of Applied Physics, 2013, `doi: 10.1063/1.4790629`_ ).
